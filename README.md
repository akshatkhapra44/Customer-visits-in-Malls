**Mall Foot Traffic Prediction**: Using a dataset that describes various malls in Melbourne, Australia, the project was able to successfully predict the number of customers coming into a particular mall at a given date (and possibly time). After applying multiple linear regression, LSTM, ARIMA, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, I decided the best model was random forest.
